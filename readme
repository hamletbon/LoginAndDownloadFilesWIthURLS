This is a simple script for downloading files with known URLs. 
Some website may not be as user friendly when it comes to downloading files, you may need to login and do multiple clicks.

By using html extraction such as http://www.convertcsv.com/url-extractor.htm , all download paths can be extracted.

These urls can be saved on a separate file.

After that all we needed is just to identify the url of the login page, and the username and password variable for a post login.

The files can then be grapped by the script.
